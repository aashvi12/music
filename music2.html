  <h3> PIANO </H3>
  <p align="justify"> The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori
    around the year 1700, in which the strings are struck by hammers. It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of
    keys that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to
    strike the strings. </p>

  <h3> GUITAR </h3>
  <p align="justify"> The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.It is typically played
    with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the finger(s)/fingernails of one
    hand, while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand. The
    sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for
    an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker. </p>

    membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the
    player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. </p>
